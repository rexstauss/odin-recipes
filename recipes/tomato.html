    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Air Fryer Roasted Tomato Soup is made by roasting fresh,<br>
        summer tomatoes, peppers, and aromatics in the air fryer. The<br>
        roasted vegetables are then blended into a smooth, creamy<br>
        soup with heavy cream, parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar,<br>
        and fresh basil. It’s a simple, flavorful soup that’s perfect for a<br>
        light lunch or dinner for two.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 small white or sweet onion</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper <i>(about 8 ounces, medium)</i></li>
        <li>1 medium carrot, <i>scrubbed clean</i></li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>Avocado oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>6 basil leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prep the veggies</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the tomatoes in half.</li>
        <li>Slice the onion into quarters or sixths.</li>
        <li>Cut the pepper into 2" pieces.</li>
        <li>Slice the carrot in half lengthwise, then<br>
            into 1" chunks.<br>
            <i>
                (Carrots take longer to cook than the other<br>
                veggies, so the pieces need to be small in<br>
                order to finish at the same time as the rest.)
            </i>
        </li>
        <li>Peel the garlic cloves (you can leave them whole).</li>
        <li>Toss the veggies in a small amount of oil. You<br>
            don't need much; just a drizzle will do.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Roast the veggies</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your air fryer to 370ºF, then cook for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip and rearrange the veggies at the 12-minute mark using tongs.<br>
            <i>(Don't shake the basket; remember there are liquids exuded from<br>
                the veggies in the basket.)</i>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Smooth out the soup using a high-speed blender</h3>
    <p><i>Peeling the tomatoes and peppers is optional if you have a high-powered blender.</i></p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add the roasted veggies to the blender. Pour in enough chicken<br>
            broth to cover the veggies, and add the vinegar, Parmesan<br>
            cheese, sugar, and basil leaves. Add a big pinch of salt and<br>
            black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Blend on high for 30 seconds, or until the soup is at your<br>
            preferred consistency.</li>
        <li>Pour the soup into a soup pot or Dutch oven set over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Skip to the "Finish the soup" step.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Or, using an immersion blender</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you’re using an immersion blender instead of an upright blender, add the<br> roasted veggies from the air
            fryer to a soup pot or Dutch oven set over<br>
            medium-high heat. Add 1 cup of chicken broth to start, along with the vinegar,<br>Parmesan cheese, sugar,
            and basil leaves (if they’re large, tear them into smaller<br>pieces). Run the immersion blender through the
            pot, pulsing until it reaches your<br>desired consistency. If the soup is too thick, add more chicken broth
            1/4 cup at a time.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Finish the soup</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Let the soup heat through for 5 to 10 minutes, then turn off<br>
            the heat and let rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the heavy cream. Taste, and add more salt and pepper as needed.</li>
    </ol>
